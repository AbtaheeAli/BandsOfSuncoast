# BandsOfSuncoast

For this project, I created a SQL database that stores bands and albums for a record company. The application accesses the SQL database through the BandsOfSuncoastContext. Foreign keys are added to the album class in order for a band to have many albums.

The application prompts the user a menu that allows them to do the following:

- View all the bands
- Add a band
- Add an album for a band
- Let a band go
- Resign a band
- View a specific band and their albums
- View all albums in order by release date
- View all bands that are signed
- View all bands that are not signed
- Quit application
